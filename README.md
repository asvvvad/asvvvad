### Welcome to my profile, Github wanderer 👋

I'm interested in Game & Web dev. Using Godot Engine, Go, PHP, and the new language V.

[![ASVVVAD's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=asvvvad)](https://github.com/asvvvad)

- 👏️ I currently code for fun but I'm constantly working on my skills to be able to do it professionally
- 📫 How to reach me: asvvvad+chat(AT)disroot(DOT)org then we'll discuss preferred IM platform from there ^^ 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go, V, Godot Engine
- ⚡ Fun fact: I got into coding through game dev, my first engine was the now dead 3DRad (but kept alive at https://classdev.net)
- - Now, I use Godot Engine for small personal projects that I may make public in the future.- 💬 Ask me about anything
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a platform which alows you to make a web page that contains annotated embeded media from across the web - ThreadLyst (name is WIP too..)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help on the project above
