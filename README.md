### Welcome to my profile, Github wanderer ðŸ‘‹

- I'm interested in Game & Web dev. Using Godot Engine, Go, PHP, and the new language V.
- I currently code for fun but I'm constantly working on my skills to be able to do it professionally
- I got into coding through game dev, my first engine was the now dead 3DRad (but kept alive at https://classdev.net)
- - Now, I use Godot Engine for small personal projects that I may make public in the future.
